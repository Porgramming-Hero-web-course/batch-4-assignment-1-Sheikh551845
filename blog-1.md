# The Significance of Union and Intersection Types in TypeScript

TypeScript's union and intersection types provide a powerful way to handle complex type relationships, enabling developers to create flexible, robust code.

## Understanding Union Types

Union types allow a variable to hold multiple types, increasing flexibility. For example, if you define a variable as `string | number`, it can hold either a string or a number. Union types are ideal for functions with variable parameter types or handling responses where data could be one of multiple types.

```typescript
function formatId(id: string | number): string {
    return `ID: ${id.toString()}`;
}
